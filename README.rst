Legless Lizard
==============

Legless Lizard is a setuptools mock of Python.net.

Python.net is a great library for interfacing with Python on .Net platforms, but it can't be installed elsewhere. This can be a problem if you want to run non-platform specific tests of a package that has `pythonnet` listed in dependencies.

What does the name mean?
------------------------

A `legless lizard <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Legless_lizard>`__ may *look*
like a snake, but doesn't behave like a snake at all.
